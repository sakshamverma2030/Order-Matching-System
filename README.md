## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used

| Concept             | Role in Project                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Structs & Classes   | Modeling orders and trades                |
| Priority Queue      | Max-heap for buy orders, Min-heap for sell orders |
| Greedy Logic        | Matching best price orders immediately    |
| Vector              | Storing executed trades                   |
| Input Validation    | Preventing invalid entries                |
| Modular Design      | Scalable architecture (optional split)    |

## 📊 Project Flow (Step-by-Step)

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1️⃣   | User enters order (type, quantity, price) |
| 2️⃣   | Input is validated |
| 3️⃣   | Order is stored in buy/sell heap |
| 4️⃣   | Matching logic checks top buy/sell |
| 5️⃣   | Trade is executed if prices match |
| 6️⃣   | Quantity is adjusted and leftovers re-added |
| 7️⃣   | Trade is stored in history |
| 8️⃣   | Order book and trade history are displayed |
| 9️⃣   | User decides to continue or exit |

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o lob
./lob
-------------------------------------------

## 📄 Sample Input
Order Type: buy  
Quantity: 100  
Price: 60  

Order Type: sell  
Quantity: 50  
Price: 58
 -----------------------------------------
## 📤 Sample Output

Trade Executed: Rs58 x 50

=== Buy Orders ===  
[Rs60 x 50] (ID 1)

=== Sell Orders ===  
(none)

=== Trade History ===  
Buy ID 1 matched with Sell ID 2 at Rs58 x 50
